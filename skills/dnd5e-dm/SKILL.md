## Adventure Design Principles

### Central Conflict

- Villain creates problem in game world
- Players resolve the conflict
- Don't determine HOW players resolve - they choose the path

### Three-Act Structure

1. **Inciting Incident** (Plot Hook) - Clear problem description + motivation
2. **Rising Action** (Adventure) - Challenges, encounters, exploration
3. **Climax** (Boss Fight) - Final confrontation
4. **Resolution** - Reward or consequences

### Key Tips

- Spread loot throughout, not just at the end
- Use variety of monster types
- Not every encounter needs combat
- Give players creative freedom to solve problems

## Encounter Building

### Monster Types (D&D 5e)

- **Brutes** (high HP, high damage) - Easy to kill
- **Skirmishers** (mobile, moderate damage) - Fast movement
- **Soldiers** (versatile, good defenses) - Balanced
- **Controllers** (area effects, debuffs) - Slower pace
- **Artillery** (ranged, high damage) - Stay back

### Encounter Design

- Fewer monsters = easier than lots of monsters
- Level 1 chars: 1 monster per 2 chars, CR ≤ ¼
- Use CR vs level ratio for difficulty
- Adjust on the fly: HP, damage, add/remove monsters

### Adventure Checklist

1. Outline the adventure (5 main scenes for 4hr game)
2. Build combat encounters
3. Prepare NPCs
4. Plan skill challenges
5. Write flavor text
6. Design puzzles
7. Calculate loot and XP
8. Prepare music/props

## Boss Fight Design

### Essential Elements

- **Minions** - Support the boss
- **Dynamic Terrain** - Changing environment
- **Legendary Actions** - 3 actions per round
- **Resistances** - Make them tough but not invincible
- **Special Abilities** - Unique mechanics

### Boss Design Tips

- Don't just put big monster in room
- Boss lair needs navigation challenges
- Mix minion types with boss
- Consider boss personality and theme

## Table Management

### Best Practices

1. **Let story develop from situation** - Don't pre-label scenes
2. **Choose monsters that fit situation** - Size the threat
3. **Keep eye on deadly encounters** - Be gentle with level 1 chars
4. **Adjust on the fly** - HP, damage, monsters
5. **Add interesting terrain** - Make battles dynamic

### DM Tips

- **Rule 0**: DM is always right (but not opponent to players)
- **Don't memorize all rules** - Make rulings, check later
- **Table Rules**: No prejudice, no party infighting, no bullying
- **Start with published adventure** - Learn from existing material
- **Keep notes** - Lots of notes!
- **NPCs**: Give them names and characteristics
- **Voices**: Optional - use gestures/posture instead
- **Preparation**: Point-form notes, be ready to wing it
- **Minis vs Theatre of Mind**: Use whichever fits the encounter
